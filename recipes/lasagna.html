            <p>If there's any month where the comfort and hands-off cooking style 
                of a casserole belongs, it's December. Indeed, in this 
                busy holiday month, casseroles offer nearly-effortless 
                ways to make a full meal with minor bits of stirring, 
                stuffing, topping, and baking. In this collection, we 
                gathered 31 casserole recipes that fit perfectly any 
                night this month, and we even offered a few options for 
                the various holidays. Browse here for four weeks of 
                casseroles that are just right for any night of 
                December.</p>
